## What is ABI-Core?

**ABI-Core** (Agent-Based Infrastructure Core) is a production-ready framework that combines:

- 🤖 **AI Agents** — LangChain-powered agents with A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication
- 🧠 **Semantic Layer** — Vector embeddings and distributed knowledge management
- 🔒 **Security** — OPA-based policy enforcement and access control
- 🌐 **Web Interfaces** — FastAPI-based REST APIs and real-time dashboards
- 📦 **Containerization** — Docker-ready deployments with orchestration
